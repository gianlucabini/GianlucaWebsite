<h1>Pre-High School ---> High School</h1>
<p> Before High School I was always thinking about walking to High School for the first time. Now I'm a week away from my last day of Freshmen year. Middle School was ruined (specifically 8th grade) from covid, which many other people situations were much worse compared to mine. But either way I've always been wanted to be in High School, and here I am! High School so far has already been filled with memories I will rememeber for ages. I'm looking forward to the next 3 years of High School and I'm hoping that it doesn't go as fast as this year.

<h1><i>Classes:</i></h1>

<p>As a Freshman I take French, English, Biology, PE, Art, Math, and Joy of Computing. I like all of these classes and am happy I took them. In each of these classes I've learned lots and I can't wait for sophmore year! I also am not a huge fan of some of these classes though, like French....I feel so out of it, but it's almost over for this year so during summer I can get a nice break.</p>

<h1>One of My Projects/ Joy of Computing</h1>
<p>This exact website you are reading right now took weeks to prepare and create and finalize. Lot's of work went into what your reading right now. It was actually super fun to get all the pictures and coding together. I also enjoyed making the collage for JOC, it was fun to kind of summarize what we have done through pictures in a collage. Joy of Computing has realy taught me the basics of coding, I've had lots of fun in this class so far and am sad that it's ending. I wish I could learn more about 3d objects being coded and how computers can recognize voices. I really was interested in the CODEHS because it was a good place to learn and have fun with the basics. </p>

<h1><i>Goal: Fluent In French</i></h1>
<p>As I am already Italian I have to do French instead of Spanish. But I don't really care, either way expanding your brain to new languages can be really good for you, and could come in handy. So my goal is to become fluent in French in the near future. TO be able to speak without thinking of a sentence prior to speaking. Or some might say- "speaking from the heart."

<h1><i>My French Academic Progress Started In 7th Grade:</i></h1>
 Those early years didn't really do much but explain and introduce the basics of the language. We have mainly always focused on grammar as do other language classes do too. I wish we practiced speaking more because that's what I actually want to be able to to. So here I am now in my first year of high school actually starting to learn the real French.</p>

 <h1><i>Other Classes:</i></h1>

 <p>For the rest of the classes it goes for the main goal of every class, get good grades and move on.</p>
