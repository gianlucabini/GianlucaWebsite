  <p class="writing">Hello! Welcome to my About Me page! My name is Gianluca Bini, and I go to Piedmont High School in California. Originally from San Francisco but moved across the bay to attend the schools of Piedmont. I am a mix of an Italian and English background, and I'm 15 years old.</p> 

<h1>Graduating Middle School</h1>
<p> Graduating Middle School was great fun, ending a chapter of my life and opening a new one. High School so far has brought new great frienships and tons of fun. Hope to keep in going.</p>

<h1>Winning The League Freshmen Year</h1>
<p>With my first year of high school soccer we won the league scoring 59 goals and conceading none. We never lost a game the whole season, meanwhile our varsity won NCS for soccer. I finished the season with 7 goals and countless assists.

<h1>Becoming Fluent In French</h1>
<p>I hope by the end of High School to be fluent in French. To be able to speak a language other than English and Italian would be a lot of fun. Because then I can go to France and truly speak to the people there.
